##### i. [wikidata](wikidata)
* Recalibrated Bengio models and feed-forward neural nets to explore WikiData and Movie reviews for language modeling tasks. 
* Deliverables also included models for statistical inference, BERT, Neural Translation, and Fakes Detection.

##### ii. [hyp-tune](hyp-tune)
* Optimized the performance with hyperparameter tuning and based on analytics from results and efficacy evaluations, tested on a batched subset of Brown corpus.

##### iii. [seq2sql](seq2seq)
* Implemented an attention-based, recursive Encoder-Decoder model, for converting the text in natural language and database schema information to structured queries.
* Employed two encoders for text and schema, and eight decoders for each of the class of SQL query words to be predicted.
* Expanded to three models (one with BERT) for the task and tabulated results of comparative analytics.
